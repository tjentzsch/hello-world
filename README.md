# hello-world
Short first repository to get started with GitHub

Hey Guys,

I am new to this kind of group and I don't have much experience at all.  I work in the solar industy and I am always looking for ways to imporove processes and the industry that I work in.  I am just starting to get back into the software engineering space and wanted to give this a try hoping it will help me improve and learn from others.  I am wanting to take this knowledge and help improve the solar industry as well to help make things more streamlined, standardized, simple, and fun.
